We are setting up our server Javascript and linking it to our controllers Javascript file that will direct the page where to go and call on the objects in our burger.js file. Inside our burger.js fie we are calling on a method to show all the data, create data, or update data. Our burger.js object are calling on our ORM javascript file to insert our query string and connecting to our database.
